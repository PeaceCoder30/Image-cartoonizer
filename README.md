# Image-cartoonizer
This project aims to provide an easy-to-use software application for transforming regular images into cartoon-like versions with unique visual styles. The Image Cartoonizer utilizes advanced algorithms and filters to automatically adjust colors, line weights, and shading to create a stylized image with an artistic appeal.
To get started, simply upload your desired image into the application. The application will then process the image and provide you with a transformed cartoon version.
We hope you find this project useful to add an artistic touch to your images.
